Getting Started

To use the FizzBuzz game script, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the repository.

Prerequisites

Python 3.x

Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the code file is located.
3. Run the following command to execute the script: fizzBuzz.py

The program will generate numbers from 1 to 100 and print the corresponding words based on the divisibility rules. 
If a number is divisible by 3, it will print "Fizz." If it is divisible by 5, it will print "Buzz." 
If it is divisible by both 3 and 5, it will print "Fizz Buzz." Otherwise, it will print the number itself.
